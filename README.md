# Project 1: Movie Trailer Website :movie_camera:
Stores a list of favorite movies, including movie details, poster and trailer. This code generates a bootstrap-based web page allowing visitors to browse movies and watch the trailers.

#Usage
All three files are required and must be saved to the same directory. Run my-movies.py.

##media.py
This defines the Movie class and accepts details about the movie as arguments (e.g. title, story, poster, actors, etc.)

##my-movies.py
This creates Movie objects using static data. I would eventually like for this data to be sourced via API, but need to learn more about making API connections. I had some success with themoviedb.org API, but need to learn more about how to parse the data returned and insert it into the rendering file. 

##render_movies.py
This generates the webpage.
